# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of the analysis was to use my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type, and lastly, submit a report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. 

## Results

Rural cities has the least amount of drivers, rides and total fares.
Urban cities have the most amount of drivers, rides and total fares.
Although Rural cities see the least amount of drivers,rides & fares the have the highest average of fare per ride and fare per driver.
Although the Urban cities command the most drivers, rides and fares they have the lowest average of fare per ride and fare per driver.


## Summary

Charge more per rides in Rural cities because they have the least amount of everything and the drivers well make more money
